# About
Amenities Map has been deceloped during MLH's HeroHacks Hackathon. It mitigates the struggle of finding different nearby amenities since COVID-19 has disrupted the opening/closing times of businesses. It also provides users with the needed safety regulations before heading out.

# Frontend Technologies Used
This project uses the latest Angular 10.14, Nebular Angular Components framework, and Bulma CSS framework.

# Backend & APIs
Radar.io's IP Geocode and Search Places APIs were used to get the location of the user as well as the nearby amenities.
